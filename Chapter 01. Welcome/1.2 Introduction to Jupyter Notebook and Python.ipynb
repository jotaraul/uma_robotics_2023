    "This interactive book has been written by means of the **Jupyter Notebook** framework, which allows us to design documents (also called **notebooks**, or **jupyter notebooks**) that combine the typical elements in a book (text, equations, figures, etc.) and multimedia resources like videos or audios with code cells that can be edited and executed. That is, such notebooks mix explanations and interactive code, all in the same way. \n",
