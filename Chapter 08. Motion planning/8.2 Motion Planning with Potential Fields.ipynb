    "After implementing the SLAM algorithm, the robots provided by **<span style=\"color:seagreen\">UMA-MR</span>** are able to simultaneously build maps of the malls and localize themselves within them. However, the **<span style=\"color:seagreen\">managers at Nirvana</span>** are looking for a fully operational robot, and something is still missing: the navigation between any two points in the malls. These points could be, for example, an information point, a shop entrance or a shop counter, a rescue point, a restaurant, etc.\n",

It consist of defining a **potential (energy) function** over the free space in the robot workspace, which has a **global minimum** at the goal and a maximum at obstacles. Then, in each iteration of the algorithm, the robot moves to a lower energy configuration, similar to a a ball rolling down a hill. To carry out such navigation the robot applies a force proportional to the **negated gradient of the potential field** (recall that the gradient always go in the direction in which the signal increases, and the robot pursues a lower energy, so it has to use the negated gradient).\n",
